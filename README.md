# Code Used
- SQL - Used MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE
- Note: There is no import Schema/table in SQL script due to using the onboard features of MySQL ("Create Schema" > "Table Data Import Wizard").
- Note: After running script for the first time, remove lines 65-66 and 68-69.

# Laptop Specifications Case Study:
This study is focuses on the observation on the laptop market and their specifications. The purpose behind this study is to plan how digital programs will be made surrounding these components. To be clear, these specifications are meant to focus on the majority of consumer devices rather than everyone. This is important because it allows businesses/companies, or smaller indie game developers, to understand how their application should be developed surrounding the user limitations. This in turn encourages more consumers to continue/start using the application due to its optimization on current hardware. 

Note that this is a personal project and that it was all conducted out of curiosity/personal interest.

# Summary

## Intro
Like many other devices, laptops have a CPU, GPU, and RAM. These components determine the performance of the application on the user's device. To clarify, the combination of components determine the overall usability of the application for consumers. The overall budget limitations determine what companies put into their devices. Understanding the common price range laptops are being sold at and their components allows developers to determine what they can do with their application in order to increase usability of the digital application.

## Tools Used
- Kaggle (Source of Dataset)
- Spreadsheet (Clean the data and create visualizations)
- SQL (Clean and format the data)
- Tableau (More visualizations)

## Conclusion
Majority of laptops in the market are within the price range of 500 to 1000 USD. In order for companies to fit within budget contraints, many of these laptops contain either an 11th gen, 12th gen, Intel Core i5, or a AMD Hexa-Core Ryzen 5 as the main choice of CPU (Processor). Secondly, companies use the Iris Xe and Integrated Graphics as the main GPU. Finally, companies use DDR4 as the main source of RAM. These specifications identify the starting point companies should use to understand what to develop their application around. 

## Where to Go From Here?
Today - Identify the goals/focus of the digital program
Tomorrow - Use the laptop specifications as a starting point to determine limitations. Determine basic and recommended specifications required to run the program
Next Year - Evaluate potential bugs that could occur with consumer devices and improve optimization based on feedback. Create a roadmap of potential features that could improve on the overall user expereince and how it can be built upon existing hardware.
